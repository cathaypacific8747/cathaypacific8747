### Why `cathaypacific8747`?

On 8 October 2016, Cathay Pacific retired its last Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft.

The 747 is one of the most iconic aircraft to have ever flown - it pioneered modern-day air travel since the 1960s. To bid farewell to its last B747-400, Cathay Pacific organised a special flight which it performed an low-altitude flyby over Victoria Harbour, at 2,000 feet.

The elegance of the flyby was truly astonishing and the scene has stuck with me ever since. This was the reason why I adopted its flight number CX8747 as my username.
