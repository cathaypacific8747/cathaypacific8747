  <summary>Why cathaypacific8747?</summary>
  
  On 8 October 2016, Cathay Pacific bid farewell to its last Boeing B747-400 passenger aircraft, marking the end of an era. The 747, renowned for its pioneering role in modern-day air travel since the 1960s, became an iconic symbol in the history of aviation. To commemorate the retirement, Cathay Pacific organised a special flight that included a breathtaking low-altitude flyby over Victoria Harbour, at 2,000 feet.

  The elegance of the flyby was truly astonishing and the scene has stuck with me ever since.
